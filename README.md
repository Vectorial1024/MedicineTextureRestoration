# Why this mod? Some recounts please?
I will provide a summary.

So, a long long time ago, there was a game RimWorld which features medicines as in-game items. The design for the medicines stayed mostly the same from the Alpha/Beta up till now, except one update which changed them.

It turned out, the texture for the medicine items were featuring a red cross. At some point during the Alpha/Beta phase, Red Cross expressed their concern of other entities misusing the symbol of the Red Cross because it was not a regular trademarked item; it was a treaty-recognized item. (e.g., ref: https://kotaku.com/video-games-arent-allowed-to-use-the-red-cross-symbol-1791265328) Following this, a number of games reviewed the appearances of red crosses inside their texture files, and RimWorld was one of them, replacing red crosses with something else.

However, it also turned out that some other mods e.g. RBSE somehow got a copy of the old medicine texture and applied it back to the game as part of their mod. That did not look like something that should be happening, especially when it was a change the game devs thought over in detail.

And so, this mod was made.

I forgot at that time, OK?
